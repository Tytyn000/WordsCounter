# WordsCounter

This is a simple Words counter made with Unity.

It can count words and characters, search the selected text with different search engines and sites, and is in French by default.

You can find the web version of this project here : https://tytyn000.github.io/WebGLBuild/

The web version has some bugs, I advise to use the windows build version.
