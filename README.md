# WordsCounter
 
WebGLBuild: 

This repo contains the WebGL versions of some of my Unity projects.

By default, there's only WordCounter in a github.io page.

You can launch the other projects by downloading them and placing them on a server. The VSCode live server can be used.

The Unity projects for these sites can be found on my GitHub.
